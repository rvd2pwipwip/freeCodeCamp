    <h1>Basic JavaScript: Generate Random Whole Numbers within a Range</h1>
    <p>
      We can generate a random number that falls within a range of two specific
      numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do this, we'll define a minimum number min and a maximum number max.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's the formula we'll use. Take a moment to read it and try to
      understand what this code is doing:
    </p>
    <p>Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min</p>
    <p>
      Create a function called randomRange that takes a range myMin and myMax
      and returns a random number that's greater than or equal to myMin, and is
      less than or equal to myMax, inclusive.
