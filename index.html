    <h1>Basic JavaScript: Record Collection</h1>
    <p>
      You are given a JSON object representing a part of your musical album
      collection. Each album has several properties and a unique id number as
      its key. Not all albums have complete information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Write a function which takes an album's id (like 2548), a property prop
      (like "artist" or "tracks"), and a value (like "Addicted to Love") to
      modify the data in this collection.
    </p>
    <p>
      If prop isn't "tracks" and value isn't empty (""), update or set the value
      for that record album's property.
    </p>
    <p>Your function must always return the entire collection object.</p>
    <p>There are several rules for handling incomplete data:</p>
    <p>
      If prop is "tracks" but the album doesn't have a "tracks" property, create
      an empty array before adding the new value to the album's corresponding
      property.
    </p>
    <p>
      If prop is "tracks" and value isn't empty (""), push the value onto the
      end of the album's existing tracks array.
    </p>
    <p>
      If value is empty (""), delete the given prop property from the album.
    </p>
    <h2>Hints</h2>
    <p>Use bracket notation when accessing object properties with variables.</p>
    <p>
      Push is an array method you can read about on Mozilla Developer Network.
    </p>

      Object Notation (JSON) for a refresher.
