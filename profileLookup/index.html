    <h1>Basic JavaScript: Profile Lookup</h1>
    <p>
      We have an array of objects representing different people in our contacts
      lists.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lookUpProfile function that takes name and a property (prop) as
      arguments has been pre-written for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The function should check if name is an actual contact's firstName and the
      given property (prop) is a property of that contact.
    </p>
    <p>If both are true, then return the "value" of that property.</p>
    <p>
      If name does not correspond to any contacts then return "No such contact"
    </p>
    <p>
      If prop does not correspond to any valid properties of a contact found to
      match name then return "No such property"
    </p>
